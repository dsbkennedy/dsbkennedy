### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Epidemiologist/Programmer with 10+ years of experience working on the collection, management, and analysis of health data. I have worked for a variety of orgnisations spanning academia, government, and the charity sector providing ample opportunities to explore differente ways of working but ulitmatley with a focus on cross-sector collaboration. 

I am also a keen educator and have developed and delivered training sessions in R, Excel, Stata, and survey data collection methods. One example of my training experience is a course that was delivered to colleagues from Africa CDC in 2021 [training material here] (https://github.com/dsbkennedy/AfricaCDCRTraining).
