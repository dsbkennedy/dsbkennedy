## Background
I am an Epidemiologist/Programmer with 10+ years of experience working on the collection, management, and analysis of health data. I have worked for various organisations spanning academia, government, and the charity sector, providing ample opportunities to explore different ways of working but ultimately with a focus on cross-sector collaboration. 

I am also a keen educator and have developed and delivered training sessions in R, SQL, Excel, Stata, and survey data collection methods. One example of my training experience is a course delivered to colleagues from Africa CDC in 2021 [training material here](https://github.com/dsbkennedy/AfricaCDCRTraining). 

In terms of analysis experience, I have substantial experience in exploratory data analysis, various regression techniques (logistic, Poisson, mixed-effects), and spatial analysis. I also completed [LSHTM's Cancer Survival](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/study/courses/short-courses/cancer-survival) course, leading to a research contract with the University of Oxford exploring time-to-event analysis comparing cancer survival outcomes by various treatment modalities. 

More recently, my focus has shifted from data analysis to data engineering, particularly the development, documentation, and assembly of datasets from routine healthcare datasets. This change in focus has led me to explore the co-integration of R with SQL and Python, an area I am keen to develop.
